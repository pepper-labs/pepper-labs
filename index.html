    <h1>We are PepperLabs!</h1>

    <p>
      For more than a decade, each of us has been proving that you don‚Äôt have to have titles or positions to have a big
      impact. After several years of working together we decided to start a new chapter in our professional lives and we
      started PepperLabs!
    </p>

    <p>Here are some thought about what we value, what we believe in and how we do business.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Giving a damn</h2>

    <p>
      Treating people right is fundamental to how we do business. We treat our customers as we‚Äôd want to be treated, we
      treat each other like friends, and we treat ourselves to a good day‚Äôs work and
      a good night‚Äôs sleep.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our goals have always been the same: do exceptional work, have fun, build the best product for our customers, pay
      attention to the details, experiment, treat people right, tell the truth, have a
      positive impact on the world around us, and keep learning.
    </p>

    <p>
      We‚Äôre also big believers in business 101. We don‚Äôt spend more than we earn, we don‚Äôt waste money on things that
      don‚Äôt matter, we don‚Äôt give away everything for free and hope we‚Äôll figure it out
      before we run out of cash. We‚Äôre in business to stay in business.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Intentionally small</h2>

    <p>We make decisions so we can stay small.</p>

    <p>
      It‚Äôs a lot easier for a small company to grow into a large one than a large one downsizing to a small one. When
      you‚Äôre small you have options ‚Äì you can stay small or go middle or go big. But once you‚Äôre big, getting smaller is
      almost always out of the question unless you‚Äôre forced in that direction. This is the problem when companies grow
      too fast ‚Äì they skip right over their options and set themselves up for big or bust.
    </p>

    <p>
      Right now we enjoy working with great clients, to have an enormous impact on our projects and to have the <em>option</em>
      to grow.
    </p>

    <p>
      This doesn‚Äôt mean however, that we aren‚Äôt looking for great talent. Check out our <a href="/careers">career page</a>!
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Direction over speed</h2>

    <p>
      We don‚Äôt chase fads and trends, we stay focused on the things that will always be important: we make big bets on
      the direction of where we‚Äôre heading over the speed we‚Äôre getting there.
    </p>

    <p>
      We work in small batches and change things that aren‚Äôt working. We allow those who are capable of leading to lead,
      no matter what their title or position is by giving them freedom and authority to work the way they want to.
    </p>

    <p>
      We fix problems at the core ‚Äì in development this would be TDD and automated builds. Once a problem is found, we
      find the root cause and put a test in place to ensure it doesn‚Äôt happen again. In our processes this would be
      retrospectives and feedback: everyone makes mistakes, so we always remind ourselves to support, not attack.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Work hard for simple and straightforward</h2>

    <p>
      We like the saying: ‚ÄúSimplicity is the art of maximizing the work not done.‚Äù This idea is central to eliminating
      waste. We make your process more agile, by doing less. Sitting with customers
      decreases the amount of formal requirements documentation we need, but it substantially increases our ability to
      understand requirements. Solutions come from feedback, communication,
      self-discipline, and trust. Feedback and direct communication reduce the need for intermediate deliverables.
      Self-discipline allows us to work without the binding overhead of formal
      structures.
    </p>

    <p>
      We‚Äôre big believers in the power of keeping it simple. Every choice we‚Äôve ever made on making something easier
      for our customers has always paid off. In the years to come, we‚Äôll continue to
      focus on simplicity, clarity, ease-of-use, and honesty. This goes for the communication with our customers, and
      for our company.
    </p>
