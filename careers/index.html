      <h2>About PepperLabs</h2>

      <p>
        PepperLabs is the missing piece of the puzzle that combines the ability to feel deeply and passionately about
        the human experience with deep technical expertise. We implement best practices and continually learn to put
        people first and help other organizations to do the same. We pair and mentor on a day-to-day basis. We
        collaborate at all levels to engineer elegant things that delight and surprise while arriving at the essence of
        what people need: meaningful outcomes and more valuable, useful, and sustainable human and software systems.
      </p>

      <strong>Impact</strong>
      <p>
        We want to create a measurable good in the world with ethical and humane organizations. Our culture is very
        strong and we try to keep it that way, and as a services company, our path to making this impact is to build our
        identity around doing exceptionally great engineering work while working with clients who make this impact
        themselves.
      </p>

      <strong>Truly* remote</strong>
      <p>
        We believe that our impact doesn’t depend on our physical location and it’s absolutely possible to collaborate
        without a downtown office - PepperLabs was founded as a remote software development agency. On top of running a
        successful remote company for more than 2 years, we’ve learned how we can work together, remotely, from any
        desk, in any place, anytime, anywhere.
      </p>

      <p><small>* This is not a temporaly thing, we won’t be "returning to office" and transition to "hybrid model". We dig working remotely! </small></p>
